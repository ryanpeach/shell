# shell

My personal customed shell as a docker container

# Running

`just run <tag>`

# Terminal Command

This is what to put in your terminal to make it run this container

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v <YOUR_HOME>:/home/rgpeach10/mnt -w /home/rgpeach10/mnt --pull=always rgpeach10/shell:main
```
